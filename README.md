## Testing

### Manual Testing

- **Click through**
    - In order to ensure that the user experience is as expected manual testing was performed on the webpage.
    - This involved clicking on all navigations links to ensure the user was brought to the desired page.
    - Testing any hover functions that had been added for navigation links and user buttons.
    - Scrolling was also tested for sticky headers.
    - After retesting and fixing bugs no more issues where found.

- **Bugs**
    - When hovering over the navigation links it was found that there was an a:active set for clicking on a link which interfere with the class a.active for underlining the active navigation tab. The a:active function was removed from the navigation links to add a more user friendly experience. 

- **Screen Resolution**
    - In order to create a user-friendly experience for desktop, tablet and mobile the webpage has been tested for screen resolution sizes.
    - This was carried out using Dev Tools and adjusting the screen resolution for each respectively.
    - After retesting the bugs that were found no issues could be noticed, this was also passed via Lighthouse.

- **Bugs**
    - There was a bug found when adjusting the screen resolution to mobile. On the homepage section for brand values the test was overflowing onto the contact us button and footer. This was adjusted and fixed by remove the height from the footer and contact button section.
    - Another bug appeared on the contact us page, because the page was not long enough it created a white space below the footer. When this was investigated a sticky footer was recommended but it was found that adjusting the height of the hero image section worked best to across all devices.

### Lighthouse Testing

- Lighthouse showed that images were too large and in order to fix this issue the files had to be compressed using resource https://tinypng.com/
